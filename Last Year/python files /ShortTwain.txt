The Notorious Jumping Frog of Calaveras County

In compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me
from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler,
and inquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested
to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion
that Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth; that my friend never knew
such a personage; and that he only conjectured that if I asked
old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous Jim
Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some
exasperating reminiscence of him as long and as tedious as it should
be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.
